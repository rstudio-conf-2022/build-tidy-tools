This will download an .exe file; once downloaded, open to start the installation. If you do not have administrator rights, the installer will default to install in your Documents folder - if you prefer, you can change the location to another folder that you have write access to.\n\n\nFor Mac\nClick “Download R for (Mac) OS X”, then “R-#.#.#.pkg” to download the installer. Run the installer to complete installation.\n\n\nFor Linux\nClick “Download R for Linux”. Instructions on installing are given for Debian, Redhat, Suse and Ubuntu distributions. Where there is a choice, install both r-base and r-base-dev.\n\n\n\nInstalling R Studio\nDownloads are available from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ (scroll to the end of the page to see the downloads). You want RStudio Desktop (Open Source License).\n\nFor Windows with no admin rights\nDownload the .zip source archive under “Zip/Tarballs”. Extract the files to a folder where you have write access, e.g. C:\\Users\\username\\RStudio. In this folder, open the bin directory and find the RStudio program: it is named rstudio.exe, but the file extension will typically be hidden, so look for rstudio. Right-click this executable to create a desktop shortcut. Double-click the executable or use the shortcut to open.\n\n\nFor all other operating systems\nDownload the relevant installer for your OS listed under “Installers for Supported Platforms”. Run the installer to complete installation."

We’ll discuss how functions present to the user, functional programming tools, and Object-oriented programming with S3 (R’s simplest system of OOP). We will also cover the tidy eval system which allows you to use tidyverse grammar in your functions.\n\nLearn efficient workflows for developing high-quality R functions, using the set of conventions codified by a package. You’ll also learn workflows for unit testing, which helps ensure that your functions do exactly what you think they do.\nMaster the art of writing functions that do one thing well and can be fluently combined together to solve more complex problems. We’ll cover common function writing pitfalls and how to avoid them.\nLearn how to write collections of functions that work well together, and adhere to existing conventions so they’re easy to pick up for newcomers.\n\nYou should take this workshop if you have experience programming in R and want to learn how to tackle larger scale problems. You’ll get the most from it if you’re already familiar with functions and are comfortable with R’s basic data structures (vectors, matrices, arrays, lists, and data frames)."
